I would like to compare my favorite movies to others using this app

So that I can find common interests with people without awkward small talk.
 

Overarching description:
Have you ever found yourself finishing a film but being unable to discuss the film with anyone? Perhaps you have searched sites such as reddit or moviechat trying to find message boards pertaining to a certain film. Maybe you would like to find other people who follow similar genres as you.
 
These problems can be solved with the Movie Compatibility Application. This application will allow users to select from a list of current/recent movies. These films will be voted on depending on if the user likes the genre or has seen the movie before. The application will then find other users who have also used the application. Compare your movie selections with theirs and give a compatibility rating. This way you can find other people who like the same genre or set of movies and begin to chat with them.
